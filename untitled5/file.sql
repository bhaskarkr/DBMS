It was directed by Nitesh Tiwari. Produced by Walt Disney Pictures, Aamir Khan Productions and UTV Motion Pictures, it stars Aamir Khan as the father. Both daughters go on to win medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games.[9] Babita won a silver medal at the Games, in the 51 kg class and gold at the 2014 Glasgow Games in the 55 kg class. In 2012, Geeta became the first Indian female wrestler to qualify for the Olympics. Mahavir''s efforts inspired dozens of Indian women to take to wrestling. Fatima Sana Shaikh and Sanya Malhotra play the older selves of the sisters while Sakshi Tanwar plays their mother and Aparshakti Khurana, their cousin.  The development of the film began in early 2013 when Tiwari began writing the screenplay before signing Khan for the film. Set primarily in the Indian State of Haryana, principal photography commenced in September 2015 in the neighbouring Punjab.[10] Satyajit Pande served as the cinematographer and Ballu Saluja as the editor. Pritam scored the film''s background music and for its soundtrack, lyrics for which were written by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Kripa Shankar Bishnoi, a coach with the Indian women''s wrestling team, trained Khan and the cast for the wrestling sequences.[11]  After a North America premiere on 21 December 2016, Dangal was released worldwide on 23 December opening to positive response with critics; praise centered on the film''s "honest" depiction of a real-life story and Khan''s performance. It was also screened at the Beijing International Film Festival in April 2017 and second BRICS festival in June 2017.[12] At the 64th National Film Awards, Zaira Wasim won Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Geeta''s younger self.

At a fashion show in London, filmmaker Kaizad Gustad spotted Kaif and decided to cast her in Boom (2003), a critical and commercial failure. While filming in India, Kaif received modelling assignments and established a successful modelling career. However, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her due to her poor command of Hindi. After appearing in the Telugu film, Malliswari (2004), Kaif earned commercial success in Bollywood with the romantic comedies Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya? (2005) and Namastey London (2007). She followed with a series of box-office hits, but was criticised for her acting, repetitive roles and inclination to male-dominated films.  Kaif''s performance in the terrorism drama New York (2009) was better received, earning her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress nomination. After roles in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani (2009), Raajneeti (2010) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), she received her second Filmfare nomination for her performance in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan (2011).
